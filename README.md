### What You Can Do
Below are listed some things you can do in the program. More features might come with future patches.

- Creating new boxes with assigned native and learning languages
- Adding as many Vocabulary-Flashcards to them as you want later
- Deleting flashcards
- Exporting & importing entire boxes to share them with friends
- Learning vocabulary with the [10-shelves-system](https://github.com/mirzamagix/vocrefine-2#the-learning-system)
- Reset a box to reset the learning progress

### Design
Vocrefine's appearance is plain and simple. The colors are **freely selectable** in the Settings section.

### Interface Languages
Yet there are few interface languages from which you can select from. You can of course [suggest more languages](https://github.com/mirzamagix/vocrefine-2/issues/new) if you need them. English is being worked on.

- German (Deutsch)

### The Learning System
Vocrefine uses the 10-shelves-system. How it works is visible in the Image below.
A new flashcard starts always in Shelf 1. Every time the the User knows the right answer the flashcard moves one Shef up (2, 3, 4, etc.). As soon as a wrong answer is entered the card moves back to the first Shelf, no matter in which Shef it was before. To "master" a card you have to know the right answer ten times in a row (so ten days in a row if decide to do so) to move the card to the invisible 11th Shelf where it stays until you decide to reset the Box.
